# 🚀 Spring Boot Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Spring Boot learning repository**! This repository is a structured showcase of my journey into the world of **Spring Boot** and modern **Java development**. It features practical projects, hands-on implementations, and real-world applications to solidify my understanding of the Spring ecosystem.

---

## 📘 Spring Boot Playground

This is my personal sandbox where I:
- 🌱 Learn Spring Boot fundamentals
- 🛠️ Build mini-projects around core concepts
- 🚧 Experiment with new ideas and techniques

Each project in this repo is created with a focus on clarity, maintainability, and demonstrating key Spring Boot features.

---

## 🛠️ What's Inside?

A curated collection of **mini-projects**, each targeting a specific topic:

- ✅ **Core Concepts**: Dependency Injection (DI), Bean Lifecycle, ApplicationContext
- ✅ **Spring Data JPA**: CRUD operations, Query Methods, Entity Relationships
- ✅ **REST APIs**: Controllers, Request Mappings, Exception Handling
- 🔐 **Spring Security** (upcoming): JWT, Authorization, OAuth
- 🧪 **Unit Testing**: JUnit 5, Mockito
- 🧩 **Real-World Apps**: Voting, TODO apps, Social Console apps
