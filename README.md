# 🚀 Spring Boot Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Spring Boot learning repository**! This repo is a collection of small projects, practice apps, and concepts I'm exploring as I dive deep into the world of **Spring Boot** and modern Java development.

# 📘 Spring Boot Playground 🚀

Welcome to my **Spring Boot Playground**! This repository is my personal sandbox where I experiment with Spring Boot fundamentals and explore the framework's features in depth. It contains a collection of mini-projects designed to strengthen my understanding and sharpen my skills in the Spring ecosystem.

---

## 🛠️ What's Inside?

This repository includes multiple **standalone Spring Boot mini-projects**, each focusing on different aspects of the framework:

- **Core Concepts**: Dependency Injection (DI), Spring AOP, Bean Lifecycle  
- **Spring Data JPA**: CRUD operations, Query Methods, Relationships  
- **REST APIs**: Controllers, Exception Handling, HATEOAS  
- **Spring Security**: Authentication, Authorization, JWT  
- **Real-World Use Cases**: Voting apps, social media console apps, TODO apps and more!  

*(More projects will be added as I explore advanced topics like Microservices, Spring Cloud, and Spring Batch!)*
