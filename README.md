# 🚀 Spring Boot Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Spring Boot learning repository**! This repo is a collection of small projects, practice apps, and concepts I'm exploring as I dive deep into the world of **Spring Boot** and modern Java development.

---

## 📘 About This Repository

This repository is my personal sandbox where I:
- Practice Spring Boot fundamentals
- Explore features like Dependency Injection, REST APIs, Spring Data JPA, and more
- Build small real-world-inspired mini-projects to strengthen my understanding

Each folder in this repo will represent a **standalone Spring Boot mini-project**.

## 📎 How to Run Projects

Each mini-project will have:
- Its own `README.md`
- Instructions to run using `Maven` or `Spring Boot`

To run a project:
```bash
cd project-folder
./mvnw spring-boot:run


# Spring Core Learning – Tax Calculation System

Welcome to my Spring learning repository! 🚀  
This project marks the beginning of my journey into the world of **Spring Framework** and **Spring Boot**. I'm starting with the **basics of Spring Core**, focusing on **Inversion of Control (IoC)** and **Dependency Injection (DI)** using XML-based configuration.

---

## 📘 What This Project Covers

- Understanding and using **Spring beans** via XML configuration.
- Creating and managing **interfaces and their implementations**.
- Injecting dependencies using the **Spring ApplicationContext**.
- Applying these concepts in a real-world-like scenario: a **tax calculator**.

### 2. 💻 Laptop Dealer (`spring-core-laptop-dealer`)
A simulation of a laptop store that sells different laptops (Dell, MacBook, Windows) with various processors (i3, i5, i7), configured using **constructor injection** in Spring XML.

**What I learned:**
- Constructor-based dependency injection
- Reusability through interfaces
- Creating multiple combinations of laptops with processors using Spring beans

**Features:**
- Clean separation between brand and processor
- Uses Spring container to assemble configurations
